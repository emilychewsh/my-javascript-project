# Digimon Dex Web application

Welcome to my first Vanilla Javascript Project!
It uses HTML, CSS & JS to create a Single Page Application.

## Description

This is a Digimon Dex that will display the first 300 Digimon Infos sourced from an external free public API

## How to Navigate the Web App

ðŸ‘¾ The page includes a scrollable list of 300 Digimons displayed on the right side of the page <br>

ðŸ‘¾ Hovering over a digimon name would automatically display the respective Digimon Data on the left of the page <br>

ðŸ‘¾ To search a particular name of a Digimon, use the search bar on top left of the page and click the "Search" button and this would display the Digimon name/names on the right <br>

ðŸ‘¾ Click the "Refresh" button to bring up the all the list of Digimons again <br>

ðŸ‘¾ The "Sort" button includes sorting the list in ascending or descending order <br>
